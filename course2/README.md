# FreeCodeCamp Bash Projects

This repository contains five Bash scripts I built while completing FreeCodeCamp's **Relational Database Project** course (Learn Bash by Building Five Programs).

## 📂 Files
1. **questionnaire.sh** – Asks questions and prints a response.
2. **countdown.sh** – Simple countdown timer.
3. **bingo.sh** – Bingo number generator (WIP).
4. **fortune.sh** – Fortune-teller script.
5. **five.sh** – Contains all the Bash programs in one file.

## ▶️ How to Run
Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x filename.sh
./filename.sh
