# 🌌 Relational Database Journey  

This repository contains my progress through the **freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification**.  
Throughout these courses and projects, I’ve used real developer tools including:  
- 💻 **VS Code**  
- 🐧 **Linux / Unix Command Line**  
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL (SQL & Databases)**  
- 🌳 **Git (Version Control)**  

The journey starts from **basic Bash commands** and gradually moves towards advanced scripting, database design with SQL, and version control with Git — ending with building real-world projects.
